# Services

This directory contains service modules that encapsulate business logic and data access operations. Services are designed to interact with external APIs, databases, or other data sources, and provide a clean interface for the rest of the application to use.

## Common Services

Some examples of services that might be included in this directory are:

- **API services**: Functions to interact with external APIs.
- **Database services**: Functions to perform CRUD operations on the database.
- **Authentication services**: Functions to handle user authentication and authorization.
- **Email services**: Functions to send emails.
- **Payment services**: Functions to process payments.

## Example Service

Here is an example of a simple service that fetches user data from an external API:

```typescript
// services/user.ts

import axios from 'axios';

/**
 * Fetches user data from an external API.
 * 
 * @param {string} userId - The ID of the user to fetch.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} - A promise that resolves to the user data.
 */
export function fetchUserData(userId: string): Promise<Object> {
    try {
        const response = await axios.get(`https://api.example.com/users/${userId}`);
        return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
        throw error;
    }
}
```
